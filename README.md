# PetStore
In this project I created a Flutter project called PetStore in which I displayed Pets using their status.
The APIs sometimes don't work correctly and give weired responses.
During one day and a half working on this project, I had did my best to consume the APIs and handle errors and exception.
It's a very fast work.
I used HTTP package,SPLASH Screen package. All the packages were brought from pub.dev
In the first Screen I did a listview returning a Card in which I displayed the name, the category name and status of the Pet. I hadn't displayed the photo from the photo URL because they were not a valid ones, so I brought a photo from google to display it in a static way. For this Screen I used the HTTP GET METHOD.
I added 2 floatingActionButtons to this Screen,one for adding a new pet and the Other for Editing a pet.
In the adding new pet screen, I developed a form to put informations about the pet and an elevated button to submit. I used HTTP POST METHOD.
Finally for editing a pet I used the same form as the adding new pet and elevated button to submit. I used HTTP PUT METHOD.

I'm happy because you gave me this opportunity to show some of my skills.
To many more projects with you.
